first functional error found is the branch statement in iglooscore2 in the main as the arg==null will never be hit as there is no way to pass a null string through xml without external packages such as xsi:nul. so this counts as an invalid input.

the second functional error is that the igloo 1 program when computing the overall score will take the first and third arguments and add them when the second and third are the highest. so I changed the s = score2; to s = score1; and the else below it to s = score2; as it was also wrong saying s = score1;
